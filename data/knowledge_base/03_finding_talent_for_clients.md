# Finding the Perfect Talent on Makers: A Guide for Clients

Makers makes it easy to connect with skilled freelancers for your projects.

## 1. Posting a Job

This is the most common way to attract proposals from interested freelancers.

*   **Be Clear and Detailed:**
    *   **Project Title:** Make it concise and descriptive (e.g., "Experienced Android Developer for E-commerce App").
    *   **Project Description:** Clearly outline the project scope, deliverables, specific tasks, and any required technologies or skills. The more detail you provide, the better the proposals you'll receive.
    *   **Skills Required:** Tag relevant skills (e.g., Python, UI/UX Design, Copywriting).
    *   **Budget:** Indicate your budget range (fixed price) or expected hourly rate. This helps filter freelancers.
    *   **Timeline:** Specify your desired project duration or deadline.
*   **Visibility:** Choose whether your job posting is public or invite-only.

## 2. Searching for Freelancers

Proactively find talent that meets your needs.

*   **Use Filters:** Search by skills, keywords, location, hourly rate, job success score, and more.
*   **Review Profiles:** Carefully examine freelancer profiles:
    *   **Portfolio:** Look at their past work samples.
    *   **Skills & Endorsements:** Check their listed skills and any endorsements from previous clients.
    *   **Work History & Feedback:** Read reviews and ratings from past projects on Makers.
    *   **Availability:** Check their stated availability.
*   **Invite to Apply:** If you find a promising freelancer, you can invite them directly to apply to your job posting or send them a message to discuss your project.

## 3. Evaluating Proposals

Once freelancers start applying to your job post:

*   **Thoroughness:** Did they read your job description carefully and address your specific needs?
*   **Relevant Experience:** Does their proposal highlight experience similar to your project?
*   **Clarity & Professionalism:** Is the proposal well-written and professional?
*   **Questions:** Did they ask clarifying questions? This shows engagement.
*   **Portfolio Review:** Re-check their portfolio in the context of your project.
*   **Price & Timeline:** Does their proposed price and timeline align with your expectations and their experience?

## 4. Interviewing (Optional but Recommended)

For complex projects or if you want to know the freelancer better:

*   **Use Makers Messaging:** Keep communication on the platform.
*   **Prepare Questions:** Ask about their approach to your project, their experience with similar tasks, and their working style.
*   **Assess Communication Skills:** How responsive and clear are they?

## 5. Hiring and Starting the Project

*   **Send an Offer:** Once you've chosen a freelancer, send them an official offer through the Makers platform. This will include the agreed scope, price, and terms.
*   **Fund Escrow (Fixed-Price):** For fixed-price projects, you'll fund the first milestone or the full project amount into escrow.
*   **Communication is Key:** Maintain regular communication with your freelancer throughout the project.

By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to finding and hiring the perfect talent for your needs on Makers.
