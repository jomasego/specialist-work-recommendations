# Dispute Resolution on Shakers

While we hope all projects go smoothly, disagreements can sometimes arise. Shakers provides a dispute resolution process to help clients and freelancers resolve issues fairly.

## When to Raise a Dispute

A dispute can be raised if:

*   **For Clients:**
    *   The freelancer fails to deliver the work as agreed in the project scope.
    *   The quality of the delivered work is significantly below what was promised or expected based on the freelancer's profile and proposal.
    *   The freelancer misses critical deadlines without a valid reason or prior agreement.
    *   The freelancer becomes unresponsive.
*   **For Freelancers:**
    *   The client fails to release payment for approved work or milestones.
    *   The client significantly changes the project scope after the project has started without agreement on revised compensation (scope creep).
    *   The client becomes unresponsive or fails to provide necessary materials/feedback to proceed with the work.

## Before Raising a Dispute

**Communication is key!** We strongly encourage both parties to try and resolve the issue directly through Shakers messaging first.

1.  **Clearly state your concerns** to the other party.
2.  **Provide specific examples** or evidence.
3.  **Propose a solution** or be open to discussing one.

Many issues can be resolved through open and honest communication.

## How to Raise a Dispute

If direct communication doesn't resolve the issue, you can initiate a formal dispute through the Shakers platform:

1.  Go to the specific project page.
2.  Find the 'Dispute' or 'Help' section related to that project.
3.  Follow the instructions to file a dispute. You will be asked to provide:
    *   A clear explanation of the issue.
    *   Supporting evidence (e.g., chat logs, files, comparison to scope).
    *   Your desired outcome.

## The Dispute Process

1.  **Notification:** The other party will be notified that a dispute has been filed and will have a chance to respond.
2.  **Mediation (Optional but Encouraged):** A Shakers dispute specialist may initially try to mediate between both parties to reach a mutual agreement.
3.  **Evidence Review:** The dispute specialist will review all evidence submitted by both the client and the freelancer. They may ask for additional information or clarification.
4.  **Decision:** Based on the evidence and our platform policies, the dispute specialist will make a decision. This decision may include:
    *   A full or partial refund to the client.
    *   Release of full or partial payment to the freelancer from escrow.
    *   Project cancellation.
    *   Other appropriate actions.

Decisions made by Shakers dispute resolution team are generally final.

## Tips for a Smoother Process

*   **Keep all communication and file sharing on the Shakers platform.** This provides a clear record.
*   **Be clear and concise in your project scope and agreements from the start.**
*   **Respond promptly to requests from the dispute resolution team.**

Our goal is to ensure a fair and efficient resolution for all parties involved.
