# How Payments Work on Shakers

We aim for a transparent and secure payment system for both clients and freelancers.

## For Clients

1.  **Funding a Project:**
    *   **Fixed-Price Projects:** You fund the project fully into an escrow account when you hire a freelancer. Funds are held securely by Shakers until you approve the work.
    *   **Hourly Projects:** You'll typically add a payment method and will be billed weekly based on the hours logged by the freelancer and approved by you.
2.  **Milestones (Fixed-Price):** For larger projects, it's recommended to break down the work into milestones. You fund each milestone, and release payment upon its successful completion and your approval.
3.  **Releasing Payments:** Once a freelancer submits work or a milestone, you review it. If satisfied, you release the payment from escrow. If not, you can request revisions or, in rare cases, raise a dispute.
4.  **Platform Fees:** Clients are charged a small processing fee on top of the project amount. This will be clearly indicated before you fund a project. Current fee: 3% of the transaction value.

## For Freelancers

1.  **Getting Paid:**
    *   **Fixed-Price Projects:** Once the client approves your submitted work or milestone, the funds are released from escrow to your Shakers account balance.
    *   **Hourly Projects:** Hours logged via our time-tracking app (if applicable) are reviewed by the client. Approved hours are paid out from the client's billing method to your Shakers balance weekly.
2.  **Service Fees:** Shakers charges a service fee on freelancers' earnings. This fee is typically a percentage of the project value and may vary based on your lifetime billings with a specific client (e.g., 20% for the first $500, 10% for $500-$10,000, 5% thereafter).
3.  **Withdrawal Methods:** You can withdraw your earnings from your Shakers account balance using several methods:
    *   Direct Bank Transfer (ACH/SEPA)
    *   PayPal
    *   Payoneer
    *   Other local options depending on your region.
4.  **Withdrawal Fees & Timing:** Each withdrawal method may have its own fees and processing times. These will be clearly displayed when you initiate a withdrawal. Typically, withdrawals take 2-5 business days to reflect in your account.

## Security

All transactions are processed through secure payment gateways. We utilize escrow to protect both parties. Never share your financial details directly with other users.
